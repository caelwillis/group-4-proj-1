Project 1 – Group 4 Project Overview	
Barret Fudge, Ben Comfort, Charity Ovando, Michael Willis

	For this project, our team will be analyzing data on the population of electric vehicles in the state of Washington. The primary questions our analysis seeks to answer are: 
1.	“What is the most popular EV manufacturer based on Washington car ownership?”
2.	“What are the most popular models from the top EV brand?”
3.	“What is the ratio of BEV vs PHEV ownership?”

To answer these questions, we will be visualizing data we obtained from Kaggle. The data shows information on Washington electric vehicle owners for the year 2023. Before we begin to visualize our data, our team must first clean all data sets, removing any N/A and blank values.

To answer question 1, we first will create a bar graph ranking the count of each car manufacturer in our dataset. We will then create a visualization to show how the production year of each car by brand; this could give us insight into who could be experiencing spike in popularity driving new car sales. We will create another visualization which will group the price of the cars by brand.

To answer question 2, we must first reference which brand is the most popular from the graphs we just created. Our team will then create a bar graph comparing showing which model of EV is the most popular from our top manufacturer.

For question 3, our team will create a pie chart showing the distribution of EV’s which are BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) vs PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle). To provide further context on this distribution, we will create another graph which groups that data by zip code.
